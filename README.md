# 📄 PDF Stamping and Auditing Automation

I built this system for one simple reason: to replace a slow, error-prone manual task with a fast, intelligent solution. If your organization handles technical PDFs at scale, this project shows what's possible when automation meets precision.

## 🛠 The Business Problem

In industries like engineering and construction, drawings are more than documents—they’re contracts, blueprints, and compliance artifacts. These PDFs often need auditing to extract key metadata—like company names, dates, or version stamps—and validate them against internal or regulatory standards.

For many teams, this process was entirely manual. Staff had to open each file, scan for relevant details, and double-check compliance rules. With hundreds or thousands of files involved, it was slow, repetitive, and highly error-prone.

The cost?

* Time lost in manual reviews
* Risk of oversight and rework
* Delays in approvals or compliance processes

That’s where this solution comes in.

## 💡 The Solution

I built a fully automated system that audits PDF engineering drawings and extracts critical metadata from predefined zones of each file. The core goals were simple:

* **Zero manual intervention**
* **Consistent accuracy**
* **Adaptability across document formats**

Here’s what the system does:

* Reads and processes PDF files regardless of size or layout
* Extracts target data such as dates, client names, and version stamps
* Validates extracted information against defined business rules
* Organizes and flags files based on audit outcomes

It’s configurable, scalable, and built for operational environments where speed and trust in the data matter.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

* **Python** – Core logic and orchestration
* **Poppler** – For precise PDF rendering and region-based parsing
* **OpenAI API** – For advanced text extraction and rule interpretation
* **YAML** – For flexible audit rule configuration

## 🎯 What Changed

Before this, my client’s team had to manually review each PDF. After deployment, the process became fully automated:

* **Hours reduced to minutes**: Batch processing slashed review times
* **Error rate dropped**: Human errors eliminated through rule-based validation
* **Scalable workflow**: System adapts to new file types and layouts with minimal updates

This gave the team confidence in their data and freed up skilled staff to focus on design and oversight—not paperwork.

## 🌍 Why It Matters

This project proves that automation isn't just about speed—it's about **removing bottlenecks from business-critical workflows**. If your organization handles documents like these—be they drawings, forms, or reports—there’s a real opportunity to simplify, standardize, and scale your operations.

I built this solution end-to-end for a paid client, but its principles apply across sectors. It’s not just tech for tech’s sake. It’s automation that pays off—in time, trust, and total operational clarity.

## 🤝 Let’s Talk

This project is fully operational, but there’s room for more:

* Smarter template recognition
* Better OCR for scanned content
* Seamless integration with document management systems

If you're facing similar inefficiencies or want to explore what intelligent automation could do for your documents, I’d be happy to connect.
